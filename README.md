# Molar mass calculator

The `molarMassCalc.py` program uses a stack-based algorithm to find the molar mass of a compound given the molecular formula. Use it at your own expense.

You can either:
- Download the `molarMassCalc.py` and `periodicTableElements.csv` and import the former into your program as modules, OR
- Download both files and run `molarMassCalc.py` directly.

Note that you must have both the `molarMassCalc.py` and `periodicTableElements.csv` files in order for the program to work.

The `oldIC.py` program was the old implementation I made where users had to manually enter in every element and its frequency. If `molarMassCalc.py` gives you problems, the `oldIC.py` will suffice instead.
